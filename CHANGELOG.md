## [Unreleased]

### Breaking

- `ckan/ckan-base` 2.10.11 introduced a reference to `EXTRA_UWSGI_OPTS` in
  `start_ckan.sh` without a default, which crashes the `ckan` container at
  startup (`unbound variable`) under `set -u` unless that variable is
  defined. `.env.example` now defines `EXTRA_UWSGI_OPTS=` to keep the
  container starting. Anyone maintaining their own `.env` (not regenerated
  from `.env.example`) must add `EXTRA_UWSGI_OPTS=` themselves before
  upgrading to this version.

### Added

- `make ci` now verifies via the CKAN API that every plugin listed in
  `CKAN__PLUGINS` was actually loaded, catching silently misconfigured or
  broken extensions (`ci-plugins` target).

### Changed

- `.env.example`: added `organization_group` and `scheming_organizations` to
  the active `CKAN__PLUGINS` list — both extensions are baked into the image
  but were not enabled.
- Dependabot now only proposes patch-level updates for `ckan/ckan-base`,
  keeping this branch on its current CKAN minor version until a maintainer
  deliberately upgrades it.
